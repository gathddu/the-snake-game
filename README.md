Hey! So, I wanted to challenge myself by recreating one of the most iconic and timeless games: Snake. On this project, I focused on replicating the simple yet addictive gameplay while adding my own touch to the coding process.

I developed this Snake game using Python, leveraging the turtle and tkinter libraries. The game logic includes movement controls, collision detection, score tracking, and a simple game-over sequence, all organized into modular functions for clarity and maintainability. The game incorporates a basic menu interface and a high-score feature.

Throughout the development process, I aimed to stay true to the spirit of the original Snake game while experimenting with code structure and optimization techniques to ensure smooth performance :).
